	"yourFractionIsYourOwnerShip": "Your fraction is your ownership percentage of the NFT. After the contract buys the NFT from OpenSea, it sends it to the fractionalizer contract, which holds the NFT and emits ERC20 fractions to be claimed by Pool participants.

The owner, therefore, is the Smart Contract (it's like a vault). And it holds the NFT in stake.",
